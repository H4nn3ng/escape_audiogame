                A horde of zombies is romping around the foosball table. 
                After a lengthy search you finally have the chance to use the cheat sheet.
                The zombies start to sense the aroma of mathematical formulas. One by one they turn their attention towards you.
                Do you want to destroy the cheat sheet or throw it at the zombies?
