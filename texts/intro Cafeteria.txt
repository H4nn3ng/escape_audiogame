            Hi there! good, you are still alive!
            You wouldn't believe how long it's been since I've seen a decent student, since I'm the last prof who remained. 
            Over time, every faculty has fallen victim to WiWi students. There were rumors that the faculty four still had some surviving students. 
            It's lucky that I found you... 

            Oh you are looking for your laptop? It's in the library?

            
            As far as I know, there are only four places, besides this cafeteria here, that you can still safely enter...

           Do you want to go to the main building, student caf√© or the library?
