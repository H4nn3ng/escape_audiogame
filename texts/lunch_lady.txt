                "Once again, the cutlery was not put next to the tray and they forgot to trash their napkins. 
                I don't understand how these students still don't understand. 
                Especially this one tutor!
                For ages he's been coming here at 12.00 for lunch and I keep clearing his stuff away.
                He only got eyes for that wretched cheat sheet he's guard with his life. 
                I wonder what's on it? Maybe you can find out? He's back there, taking the elevator."

                Do you want to search the tutor?
