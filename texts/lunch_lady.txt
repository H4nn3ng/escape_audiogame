"Once again, the cutlery was not put next to the tray and they forgot to trash their napkins. 
I don't understand how these students still don't understand. 
Especially this one tutor!
For ages he's been coming here at exactly 12 o' clock for lunch and I keep clearing his stuff away.
He only got eyes for that wretched cheat sheet he's guard with his life. 
I wonder what's on it? Maybe you can find out? He's back there, taking the elevator."

Once again, the cutlery was not placed next plates, and the napkins were left on the tray.
I don't understand why these students don't get it.
And this tutor, in particular, is a problem.
For as long as I can remember, he comes here every day at 12 for lunch and I always have to clean up after him.
He's fixated on that cheat sheet he's holding so tightly.
I wonder what's on it. Maybe you can find out. He's back there near the elevator."
