            You're standing in the entrance of the main building. To the right you're seeing a cone of light illuminating the floor, originating from the Audimax.
            To the left you're seeing a slim shape sitting in the familiar small porter cabin. A doorkeeper!
            Do you want to enter the Audimax or talk to the doorkeeper?
