            You stand in the main building entrance. To the right you're seeing a cone of light illuminating the floor, originating from a lecture hall.
            To the left you see a slim shape sitting in the familiar small porter cabin. A doorkeeper!
            Do you want to enter the lecture hall or talk to the person?
