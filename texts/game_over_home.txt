            You decide to stay a little longer. 
            All of a sudden you hear a metallic voice as a steel behemoth builds up in front of you: 
            "Return your books! You're already 5 months past your deadline. You are EXMATRICULATED!" GAME OVER!!!

            Do you want to restart?
