The cafe is empty but the zombies left a holy mess. You grab the key for the library and run over the campus.
As you stand in front of the door, you carefully slide the key in the lock and open it. Luckily! Its time to get your laptop.
You stand in the unpleasened light sorrounded by the wisdom of centuries.
The only thing thats missing in those infinite bookshelves seems to be a book in your backpack. Maybe you should return it.

Do you want to return the book or search for your laptop?
