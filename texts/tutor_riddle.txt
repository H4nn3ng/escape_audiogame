                You stroll through the Math building as a dark figure rises from the shadows near the elevators. 
                A hood covers his face and he speaks:

                "I can't believe my eyes! 
                For eons, I've been the guardian of the Math building and protector of the cheat sheets. 
                Are you a worthy heir to my legacy? Prove your worth by solving this riddle:

                If you have 4 apples and you take away 3, how many do you have?"

                State the answer.
