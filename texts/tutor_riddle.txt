You stroll through the Math building as a dark figure rises from the shadows at the elevators.
With a hood deep in the face he speaks:

"I can't believe my eyes!
For aeons I'm the guardian of the Math building and protector of the cheat-sheets!
Are you a worthy heir to my legacy?
Solve this riddle to test your capability!  

If there are 4 apples and you take away 3, how many do you have?"
