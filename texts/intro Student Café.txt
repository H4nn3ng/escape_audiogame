            You look through the window into the caf√©. There is the key for the library on the foosball table. 
            But great danger lurks in the cafe! A pack of inflation-radiated WiWi zombies squat in the middle of the room and perform an infinite accounting.
            The only that could distract them are the cheat sheets.

            Where do you want to go next? To the library, cafeteria or main builidng?
