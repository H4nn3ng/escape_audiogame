            You peek through the window into the café. On the foosball table, you see the key to the library.
            However, great danger lurks in the café! 
            A pack of inflation-radiated WiWi zombies squats in the center of the room, performing an endless accounting calculation. 
            The only thing that could distract them are cheat sheets.

                  Where would you like to go next? The library, cafeteria, or main building?
