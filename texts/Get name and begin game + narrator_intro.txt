"Hi $person you are still alive!
You wouldn't believe how long it's been since I've seen a decent student , since I'm the last prof who remained. Over time, every faculty has fallen victim to WiWi students. There were rumors that the faculty four still had some surviving students. It's lucky that I found you... Oh you are looking for your laptop? It's in the library?
This is going to be a tricky business....
As far as I know, there are only four places, besides this cafeteria here, you can still safely enter.
The main building, the math building, the student café and the library.
So you are lucky, good luck! As the prof leaves you are standing in the foyer of the cafeteria. A queasy feeling creeps over you...
Because where there is usually a lively hustle and bustle of hungry students,
it is now almost completely quiet. Only the slow rotation of the abandoned pasta machine pervades the silence.
Which of the following places do you want to enter? Main building, Student Café, library.
