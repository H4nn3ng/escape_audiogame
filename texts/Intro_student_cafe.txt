You look through the window into the caf√©. On the foosball table of the planned economy lies the key for the library. 
But great danger lurks in the cafe! A pack of inflation-radiated WiWi zombies squat in the middle of the room and perform an infinite accounting.
The only thing that can still lure these number-hungry creatures away from the key
are the cheat sheets. Find them and use them as bait to lure the zombies out of the room.
But note. The zombies will roam around the campus after being lured out. So be extra careful with your decisions. 
Where do you want to go next? To the library, cafeteria or main builidng?
