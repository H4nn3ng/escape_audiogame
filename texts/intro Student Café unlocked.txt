                You peek through the window into the café. On the foosball table, you see the key to the library.
                However, great danger lurks in the café! 
                A pack of inflation-radiated WiWi zombies squats in the center of the room, performing an endless accounting calculation. 
                The only thing that could distract them are cheat sheets which you have found after a lengthy search

                The zombies start to sense the aroma of mathematical formulas. One by one they turn their attention towards you.
                Do you want to destroy the cheat sheet or throw it at the zombies?
